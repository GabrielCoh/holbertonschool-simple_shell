.SH NAME
simple shell - create a UNIX command interpreter.

.SH SYNOPSIS
simple shell
followed by a command

.SH DESCRIPTION
simple_shell is a custom command-line interpreter that provides n user interface for UNIX-like operating systems, which executes commands from the standard input. This works in both interactive and non-interactive modes: either by typing an entire command or by executing a file that includes one or more commands.

.SH EXAMPLES
Example of interactive mode:


$ ls -l

-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  1086 Jan 10 09:34 read_stream.c

-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   980 Jan 10 09:34 simple_shell.c

-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   533 Jan 10 09:34 simple_shell.h

-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  1021 Jan 10 09:34 split_line.c

$

Example of non interactive mode:

root@user:$ cat test_ls | ./hsh

read_stream.c		simple_shell.c		simple_shell.h		split_line.c


.SH ARGUMENTS
simple_shell
command arguments will be typed after the main command followed by a space and a '$' symbol.

.SH RETURN VALUE
On success the shell returns the result of the command typed into it. If there is an error it will return an error message or will exit itself.

.SH ERRORS
In case of errors, please report them to the authors of this project.

.SH SEE ALSO
